# Tewiba
**Tewiba**, **Te**sting **Wi**th **Ba**sh,  is a simple integration and functional test suite, in the unix spirit. It is written in bash but aims at testing any linux tools the unix way.

## Requirements

- An unix-like system with the GNU utilities (e.g, any Linux but not vanilla MacOS nor freebsd)
- bash at least version 4.3

## Features

- Each test or series of tests is a shell script, or any executable file: This system is more geared to test unix programs the unix way - handling them via a shell and looking at the exit code and sterr, rather than testing only bash scripts. (hence the WIth BAsh)
- No API to learn to write scripts. Just use the normal unix conventions:
  - Success is indicated by exiting with the 0 exit code
  - Description of problems in stderr
  - Mundane info on stdout 
- Does not try to reinvent the wheel. If you want to write sophisticated rules to test the results, there is already all the power of Bash, no need to invent another language, like most test suite do.
- Some convenience functions are provided however: TEST, TERR, TEND, ...
- Tewiba is geared towards integration and functional testing: complex, large grain, where the difficulty is to setup the testing environnement (a database, a web server, a subversion server, ...), and allows grouping tests in directories, with specialized code to set up and clean up before and after the tests. But since each test consists in running an unix program, it is not adapted for fine-grained unit testing.
- Tewiba is a self-contained script, with no dependencies, easily embeddable in your source code with a non-viral license (MIT)
- Geared for various custom tests in mixed environnements, in silent mode. Useful for integration tests where each test can be quite complex and do not additional complexity from the test framework. 

For another shell test framework, more specialised in unit tests for shell scripts, please see SHunit2 at https://github.com/kward/shunit2

## Getting Started
1. Extract the distribution somewhere, cd to it and run `./tewiba` that should exit silently, meaning all its internal tests passed.
1. Copy the`tewiba` shell script somewhere  in your PATH (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`, `~/bin`)
1. Create a `tests` directory inside your project directory
1. Write your tests as executable files with a `.test` extension, in bash or in any language, as long as they return the number of errors as their status (0 meaning success)
1. Run `tewiba` to launch your tests. it will exit silently if everything is OK.
1. Read more info in the [Tewiba documentation](doc/tewiba-doc.md).

A simple example to test the available `date` version:
```
#!/bin/bash
[ -n "$TEWIBA" ] || exec tewiba -v "$0"  #autorun tewiba

TEST "date is installed?"
hash date || TERR date command not found

TEST "check that date is GNU date, at least version 8"
version=$(date --version)
[[ $version =~ "date (GNU coreutils)" ]] || TERR date is not the GNU version of date
[[ $version =~ "date (GNU coreutils) *"([0-9]+) ]] TERR could not determine date version
let "${BASH_REMATCH[1]} >= 8" || TERR date version is not at least v8

TEST "just check date works as intended on a simple case"
[ $(date -d @1234567890 +%Y-%m-%d) = 2009-02-13 ] || TERR date error converting time 1234567890
[ $(date -d 2009-02-13T23:31:30Z +%s) = 1234567890 ] || TERR date error converting date 2009-02-13T23:31:30Z

## Test suite

The tests for tewiba itself are in the `tests` directory, of course. Run them by running `tewiba`. You can look at them for examples of tests, look at the `README.md` in the `tests` directory.
